Middleware
==========

A WSGI middleware is a WSGI app that wraps another app
in order to observe or change its behavior. Werkzeug provides some
middleware for common use cases.

    proxy_fix
    shared_data
    dispatcher
    http_proxy
    lint
    profiler

The :doc:`interactive debugger </debug>` is also a middleware that can
be applied manually, although it is typically used automatically with
the :doc:`development server </serving>`.
